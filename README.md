## 📊 API Endpoints

The application attempts to connect to a backend API at `http://localhost:4000` with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/customers` - Fetch customer data
- `GET /api/products` - Fetch product catalog
- `GET /api/orders` - Fetch order history
- `GET /api/recent-activity` - Fetch recent system activities

### Fallback Mechanism

If the API is not available (e.g., backend server is down), the application automatically falls back to using the local `DummyData.json` file. This ensures the application remains functional for demonstration purposes.
